           &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;समग्र e-KYC (Electronic Know Your Customer) एक डिजिटल प्रक्रिया है, जिसके माध्यम से नागरिकों की पहचान और उनके दस्तावेज़ों का सत्यापन ऑनलाइन किया जाता है। यह प्रक्रिया समग्र पोर्टल (samagra.gov.in) पर उपलब्ध होती है और इसे आधार आधारित सत्यापन के माध्यम से किया जाता है।&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;          &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;        &lt;div class=&#34;card document-list&#34;&gt;&#xA;          &lt;div class=&#34;card-header&#34;&gt; &#xA;            &lt;span&gt; 📢&lt;/span&gt;
