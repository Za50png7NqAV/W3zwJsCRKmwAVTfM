दोपहिया, तिपहिया, चौपहिया या अन्य।\rअपने वाहन की जानकारी भरें: अपने वाहन का रजिस्ट्रेशन नंबर, चेसिस नंबर (RC कार्ड से मिल जाएगा) और इंजन नंबर दर्ज करें।\rफिटमेंट लोकेशन चुनें: अपने नजदीकी HSRP फिटमेंट सेंटर का चयन करें जहां आप प्लेट लगवाना चाहते हैं।\rअपॉइंटमेंट डेट और टाइम स्लॉट चुनें: अपनी सुविधानुसार डेट और समय का चयन करें।\rफीस का भुगतान करें: ऑनलाइन भुगतान के माध्यम से (क्रेडिट/डेबिट कार्ड, UPI, नेट बैंकिंग) HSRP की फीस का भुगतान करें।\rपावती डाउनलोड करें: भुगतान के बाद स्क्रीन पर दिखाई देने वाली पावती को डाउनलोड करें और प्रिंट करें। इसे अपॉइंटमेंट के समय साथ लेकर जाना जरूरी है।\rमहत्वपूर्ण जानकारी: सही और सटीक जानकारी भरें। गलत जानकारी देने पर आपका आवेदन रद्द हो सकता है या फिटमेंट के समय समस्या हो सकती है।\rजरूरी दस्तावेज़\rHSRP लगवाने के लिए निम्नलिखित दस्तावेज़ तैयार रखें:\nवाहन की RC (रजिस्ट्रेशन सर्टिफिकेट): मूल RC की फोटोकॉपी या डिजिटल RC (mParivahan ऐप पर)\rवाहन का बीमा प्रमाण पत्र: वैध बीमा पॉलिसी की कॉपी\rपहचान प्रमाण: आधार कार्ड, पैन कार्ड, ड्राइविंग लाइसेंस में से कोई एक\rएड्रेस प्रूफ: आधार कार्ड, पासपोर्ट, बिजली बिल में से कोई एक\rमोबाइल नंबर: वैरिफिकेशन और अपडेट के लिए आपका एक्टिव मोबाइल नंबर\rईमेल आईडी: ऑनलाइन बुकिंग की पुष्टि के लिए\rपेमेंट की रसीद: ऑनलाइन बुकिंग के बाद मिली पावती\rHSRP के लिए शुल्क (फीस)\rHSRP की फीस वाहन के प्रकार और राज्य के अनुसार अलग-अलग हो सकती है। यहां एक सामान्य फीस स्ट्रक्चर दिया गया है:\nवाहन का प्रकार\rफीस (लगभग)\rदोपहिया वाहन\r₹400 - ₹600\rतिपहिया वाहन\r₹600 - ₹800\rहल्के वाहन (कार)\r₹800 - ₹1,100\rभारी वाहन (बस, ट्रक)\r₹1,100 - ₹1,500\rनोट: उपरोक्त फीस में कलर स्टिकर और फिटमेंट चार्ज शामिल हो सकता है। सटीक शुल्क के लिए आधिकारिक वेबसाइट देखें या आपके राज्य के परिवहन विभाग से संपर्क करें।\rअक्सर पूछे जाने वाले प्रश्न (FAQs)\rक्या पुराने वाहनों के लिए भी HSRP जरूरी है?\rहां, सभी पुराने और नए वाहनों के लिए HSRP अनिवार्य है। पुराने वाहनों के मालिकों को भी निर्धारित समय सीमा के भीतर HSRP लगवाना जरूरी है।\rHSRP लगवाने की समय सीमा क्या है?\rयह राज्य के अनुसार अलग-अलग हो सकता है। अधिकांश राज्यों में इसे अनिवार्य कर दिया गया है और अब बिना HSRP के वाहन चलाना अवैध है। अपने राज्य के परिवहन विभाग से नवीनतम अपडेट के लिए संपर्क करें।\rक्या मैं HSRP को खुद लगा सकता हूं?\rनहीं, HSRP को केवल अधिकृत डीलर या फिटमेंट सेंटर पर ही लगाया जा सकता है। स्वयं लगाना अवैध है और इसके लिए चालान हो सकता है।\rमेरे वाहन पर पहले से HSRP लगा है, क्या मुझे फिर से लगवाना होगा?\rनहीं, अगर आपके वाहन पर पहले से ही आधिकारिक HSRP लगा है तो आपको फिर से लगवाने की आवश्यकता नहीं है। आप अपनी HSRP को सत्यापित करने के लिए अपने स्थानीय RTO में जांच करवा सकते हैं।\rक्या मुझे रंगीन स्टिकर (फ्यूल स्टिकर) भी लगवाना जरूरी है?\rहां, HSRP के साथ-साथ रंगीन फ्यूल स्टिकर भी अनिवार्य है। यह स्टिकर आपके वाहन के ईंधन प्रकार (पेट्रोल/डीजल/CNG/इलेक्ट्रिक) को दर्शाता है और इसे विंडशील्ड पर लगाया जाता है।\rराज्य-विशिष्ट जानकारी\rविभिन्न राज्यों में HSRP लगवाने की प्रक्रिया और नियम थोड़े अलग हो सकते हैं:\nदिल्ली: सभी वाहनों के लिए अनिवार्य, बिना HSRP के ₹5,500 तक का जुर्माना\rमध्य प्रदेश: चरणबद्ध तरीके से लागू, पहले चार चक्का वाहन और फिर दो चक्का वाहन\rमहाराष्ट्र: सभी नए और पुराने वाहनों के लिए अनिवार्य\rराजस्थान: अब सभी जिलों में HSRP लगवाना अनिवार्य\rउत्तर प्रदेश: चरणबद्ध तरीके से लागू, विशेष अभियान चलाए जा रहे हैं\rगुजरात: सभी वाहनों के लिए अनिवार्य, बिना HSRP के वाहन नवीनीकरण नहीं होगा\r\u003c\rयाद रखें: HSRP एक सरकारी अनिवार्यता है और इसे केवल अधिकृत वेबसाइट या डीलर से ही बुक करना चाहिए। किसी भी अनाधिकृत स्रोत से HSRP न लगवाएं क्योंकि यह अवैध है और इसके लिए आपको कानूनी समस्याओं का सामना करना पड़ सकता है।\rImportant Links\rAction\rApply for High Security Registration Plate\rBook HSRP\rApply for HSRP\rBook HSRP Punjab State\rFollow Us\rTelegram | Whatsapp\rMP Vehicle Registration Search\rFind Engine No. / Chassis No.by Registration No.\rOfficial Website\rBOOK MY HSRP Official Website\r© 2025 BOOK MY HSRP भारत सरकार द्वारा अनुमोदित\nनवीनतम अपडेट के लिए अपने राज्य के परिवहन विभाग की आधिकारिक वेबसाइट देखें\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to/book-my-hsrp-online/","title":"Book HSRP Online Apply 2025"},{"content":"\rImportant Links\rAction\rSamagra Profile Update\rSamagra Correction\rSamagra ID Print\rBy Family Id | By Member ID | Search by Name\rFollow For More\rJoin Telegram |Join Whatsapp\rOfficial Website\rSamagra Official Website\r","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to/samagra-id-profile-update-mp/","title":"Samagra Id Online Correction Form MP 2025"},{"content":"\rलाड़ली बहना योजना संबंधित महत्तपूर्ण लिंक\rImportant Links\rAction\rLadi Bahna Yojna Status\rCheck Status\rLadi Bahna Yojna Aadesh\rDownlaod\rFollow For Latest Update\rWhatsApp | Telegram\rOfficial Website\rCM LBY Official Website\r","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/mp/ladli-bahna-yojna-24th/","title":"MP Ladli Bahna Yojna May 2025 Payment News – Check 24th Installment Now"},{"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to/samagra-marital-stutus-correction/","title":"Marital Stutus Correction in Samagra 2025"},{"content":"\rCBSE कक्षा 10वी एवं 12वीं का परिणाम 2025 कैसे देखें\rघोषणा की तारीख: 13 मई 2025\nऑनलाइन रिजल्ट चेक करने के चरण:\rआधिकारिक वेबसाइट पर जाएँ:\ncbse.gov.in\rresults.cbse.nic.in cbseresults.nic.in 10वीं रिजल्ट लिंक खोजें: \"high School (Class X) Results 2025\" या \"CBSE Class 10 Result 2025\" लिंक पर क्लिक करें।\r12वीं रिजल्ट लिंक खोजें: \"Senior Secondary (Class XII) Results 2025\" या \"CBSE Class 12 Result 2025\" लिंक पर क्लिक करें।\rजानकारी भरें:\nरोल नंबर, स्कूल नंबर, एडमिट कार्ड आईडी (और यदि माँगा जाए तो सेंटर नंबर) दर्ज करें।\rसबमिट करें और परिणाम देखें: \"Submit\" पर क्लिक करें और अपना परिणाम स्क्रीन पर देखें।\rडाउनलोड और प्रिंट: रिजल्ट का स्क्रीनशॉट लें या PDF डाउनलोड करें।\rरिजल्ट देखने के वैकल्पिक तरीके:\r1.
